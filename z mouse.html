<h1>What is a mouse? </h1>
<p>A mouse is a small device that a computer user pushes across a desk surface in order to point to a place on a display screen and to select one or more actions to take from that position. The mouse first became a widely used computer tool when Apple Computer made it a standard part of the Apple Macintosh.</p>

<p>Today, the mouse is an integral part of the graphical user interface (GUI) of any PC. The mouse apparently got its name by being about the same size and color as a toy mouse.</p>

<p>Mice typically have two buttons, a scroll wheel and a laser sensor. They are used to move the cursor on the screen, select objects and click on buttons.<p>
