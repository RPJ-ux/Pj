<h1>What is System Unit</h1>
<p>
The system unit, also known as a "tower" or "chassis," contains the main components of a desktop computer. It includes the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and other components. The case that houses these components is also part of the system unit.
</p>
<p>
Peripheral devices, such as the monitor, keyboard, and mouse are separate from the system unit. Peripherals, combined with the system unit, create a "workstation."
</p>
<p>
Some modern computers, such as the iMac, combine the system unit and monitor into a single device. In this case, the monitor is part of the system unit. While laptops also have built-in displays, they are not considered system units, since the term only refers to desktop computers.
